# The Shortest Path in Pacman Maze
There are several mazes in '/layout' address and Pacman's aim in all of them is to find the shortest path to the goal cell. This problem is solved using AI basic algorithms including A*, DFS, BFS, and UCS. Moreover, a comparison is made between them based on the cost of the path and the required time.
